How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I take information from a client or their customers and list them. One I find what the customers and clients need and want, it is much easier to categorize their priority level. One way I can do this is with user stories. User stories allow me to break requirements into chunks, find what I need for that specific chunk to be usable or up to the customers standards, and complete a portion of the project incrementally. This was the most important things are done first within a timeline and extra wants from the clients and customers can be added later within the timeframe after the bulk is finished.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs by looking at the initial plan and the final goal. This way I can see a path on which I can take to reach that end goal. Without seeing these two things, your program may branch off or end up something you did not want. Some Agile processes that I hope to incorporate in the future are all of them. I think iterative cycles are necessary to break a large project into smaller, much more manageable chunks. Adaptability and Communication are something that I already do, but could improve on in terms of taking account all members’ input and being able to change directions once new information is added to a project. Lastly, continuous improvement is necessary for all things, so that your abilities don’t become stale.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means having open communication and being accountable for your fork and others. Communication is the focus of the Agile Method, allowing all members to have input withing the team and the client being introduced into the development process. Communicating as a team member not only informs other teammates about your progress but also allows you to ask them vital information that could allow the project to flourish or be better than it once was before. Along with that, accountability for your part of the project allows you to keep pushing forward with information that may not have been available before allowing adjustments in the process saving time, effort, and money for the team and client.
